- Self-hosted etcd: if `etcd-hosts.checkpoint` file exists under `${datadir}/`,
  etcd pod will restore the hosts mapping from it before etcd bootstraps.
- Add static TLS support for self-hosted etcd mode.
- Add additional label `{"selfHosted": ""}` to self-hosted etcd pod.

### Changed

- Self-hosted etcd: use FQDN for client/peer URL.

## [Release 0.2.6]

### Upgrade Notice

- Once operator is upgraded, all backup-enabled cluster will go through an upgrade process that
  deletes backup sidecar's ReplicaSet and creates new Deployment for sidecar.
  If upgrading failed for any reason, cluster TPR's `status.phase` will be FAILED.
  Recreate of the cluster TPR is needed on failure case.

### Added

- PodPolicy provides `EtcdEnv` option to add custom env to the etcd process.
- PodPolicy provides `Labels` option to add custom labels to the etcd pod.
- TLS feature: user can now create TLS-secured cluster via operator.
  See [TLS guide](https://github.com/coreos/etcd-operator/blob/master/doc/user/cluster_tls.md).

### Changed

- Self-hosted etcd pod's anti-affinity label selector is changed to select `{"app": "etcd"}`.
  That is, no two etcd pods should sit on the same node, even if they belongs to different clusters.
- Using Deployment to manage backup sidecar instead of ReplicaSet.
- S3 backup path is changed to `${BUCKET_NAME}/v1/${NAMESPACE}/${CLUSTER_NAME}/`.

## [Release 0.2.5]

### Added

- Add "none" PV provisioner option. If operator flag "pv-provisioner" is set to "none",
  operator won’t create any storage class and users couldn’t make use of operator’s PV backup feature.
- Add headless service `${clusterName}` which selects etcd pods of given cluster.
- Pod Tolerations.

### Changed

- TLSSpec json tag changed as `omitempty`
- Time related fields in spec, i.e. TransitionTime and CreationTime, is changed to type `string`.
  This should be backward compatible and no effect on operator upgrade.
- Update default etcd version to 3.1.4
- Self-hosted etcd pod is started with "--metrics extensive" flag.
  This is only available in etcd 3.1+.
- Change client LB service name to `${clusterName}-client`.
- Add hostname and subdomain to etcd pods, which makes them have A records formatted in `${memberName}.${clusterName}.${namespace}.svc.cluster.local` .
  For more info, see https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/dns-pod-service/ .
  We also change PeerURL of etcd members to use such hostnames.

### Removed

- Individual etcd member's services were removed. Use hostname and subdomain of etcd pod instead.
