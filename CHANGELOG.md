## [Unreleased 0.2.5]

### Added

- Add "none" PV provisioner option. If operator flag "pv-provisioner" is set to "none",
  operator won’t create any storage class and users couldn’t make use of operator’s PV backup feature.
- Add headless service `${clusterName}` which selects etcd pods of given cluster.

### Changed

- TLSSpec json tag changed as `omitempty`
- Time related fields in spec, i.e. TransitionTime and CreationTime, is changed to type `string`.
  This should be backward compatible and no effect on operator upgrade.
- Update default etcd version to 3.1.4
- Self-hosted etcd pod is started with "--metrics extensive" flag.
  This is only available in etcd 3.1+.
- Change client LB service name to `${clusterName}-client`.
- Add hostname and subdomain to etcd pods, which makes them have A records formatted in `${memberName}.${clusterName}.${namespace}.svc.cluster.local` .
  For more info, see https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/dns-pod-service/ .
  We also change PeerURL of etcd members to use such hostnames.
- S3 backup path on S3 bucket is changed to `${BUCKET_NAME}/v1/${NAMESPACE}/${CLUSTER_NAME}/`.

### Removed

- Individual etcd member's services were removed. Use hostname and subdomain of etcd pod instead.
